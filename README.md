This is an idea I had - Make a circle, and rotate it using a slider. I mostly created this without any help, but I did have to use ChatGPT to help me add a couple lines to make it actually work. This is a common approach of mine, but then I go back and thoroughly study the code that AI gave me. I seek to understand it, then I rewrite it and study it repeatedly until I fully understand it, and then own it as mine.
